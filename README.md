Text a message to a mass amount of numbers (kept in an excel sheet)

I developed this project for a friend who was doing research for a professor. She needed a way to text a thousands of underprivileged high schoolers regarding an opportunity for a college scholarship. She initially used a program that costed a couple of hundreds of dollars to use. I told her that I could make something similar but much cheaper using the Twilio API.


I got to work: testing to send a message to a single number, importing data from excel sheets and putting it all together.
This project ended with my friend saving hundreds of dollars, a happy professor, and a developer who gained experience using the Twilio API.

If you want to use the program, change the variables SID, AUTH_TOKEN, SENDER_NUMBER, EXCEL_SHEET, and MESSAGE.
You should also change the column names as it refers to specific columns.
